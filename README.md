# Wagtail Gatsby Blog (Frontend)

Example project for me to figure out how to connect Wagtail as CMS on the
backend with Gatsby for the frontend.

This setup is only designed for a single developer creating the site locally
and then deploying the CMS on a webserver. Once the production server is up
and running, all changes to content and media should be done directly on the
production server (as I am not sure about any good merging strategies).
